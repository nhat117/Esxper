# COSC2638 - Cloud Computing
# Project Title
**Exsper-IMDb**

## Description

In this project, the team utilizes the fundamentals of cloud computing to develop a web application, which is deployed on Amazon Web Services. By integrating multiple cloud services such as AWS Amplify, Amazon Cognito, Amazon S3, Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams & Firehose, and Amazon Personalize, we could quickly ship a complex system where usersâ€™ data could be collected, and reproduce for analytics and improve the business logic.
